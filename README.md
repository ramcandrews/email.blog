# email.blog
a flask bloging platform. Listen to an imap folder and then post the messages as blog posts.

## Purpose
I am interested in making blogging fast and easy by using email as the writing interface. Eventually I will use this platform to test out AI powered UI experiments.

## Roadmap --> 1.0 
### Getting the platform off of the ground
1. Convert message subject to blog post title.
2. Convert plain text body to blog post.
3. Integrate markdown and HTML formating from multi-part messages.
4. disply inline images in posts. Display/embed attachments in posts.
5. some kind of password or authentication. 

## Roadmap 1.0 --> 2.0
### AI integration
1. Autofetch links; screenshot, thumbnail and scrape content.
2. Summarize scraped content for thumbnail caption.
3. Read text from images
4. Image auto-tagging
